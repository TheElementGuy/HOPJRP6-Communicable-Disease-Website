                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>Covid-19 arose in China, and is believed to have come from an infected animal, much like ebola. It then infected many in huge amounts, and spread around the world. We all went into lockdown as schools, offices, and stores closed down. We are now slowly coming out of lockdown, but masking is still common. The vaccine was developed in record time, and became the first of a <a href="vaccines.html">new type of vaccine</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Treatments & Prevention</h2>
                        <p>There are a few medicines for Covid-19, such as Paxlovid, Lagevrio, and Veklury. Additionally, symptoms can be relieved with over the counter meds such as Tylenol, Ibuprofin, or Aspirin. Covid-19 spreads through the air, so masks can stop person to person transmission. As with all diseases, you can also wash your hands regularly. Several Covid-19 vaccines are also available, so make sure to get your shots and boosters.</p>

                <h2>Spread/Causes</h2>
                <p>Covid-19 spreads through the air via coughing and sneezing. It comes in little droplets with many copies of the virus. Masks block the droplets, so you have a lesser chance of getting sick. Covid-19 is mildly contagious, but spread quickly when no one was vaccinated.</p>
                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <div class="w3-container w3-theme-d1">
                    <p>Symptoms of Covid-19 include fever, chills, coughing, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, fatigue, body and muscle aches, headaches, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Some people need breathing help from machines or extra oxygen.</p>
