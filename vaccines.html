                <h2>Vaccines: What Are They?</h2>
                <p class="w3-large w3-panel w3-card-4 w3-theme-l3 w3-padding">Vaccines are an injection, typically in the skin, that contain dead or weakened pathogens. They deliver protection against the disease that the pathogen causes.</p>
                <p>That's it.</p>
                <h2>How do they work?</h2>
                <p><i>We strongly recommend reading the <a href="immunesystem.html">immune system page</i></a>.<br>When the pathogen is injected into the body, it is accompanied by chemicals that activate the Adaptive Immune System. The body produces antibodies and Memory Cells to remember the infection. Then, when you get the real deal disease, your body is prepared and you don't die.</p>
                <p class="w3-large w3-panel w3-card-4 w3-theme-d5 w3-padding">Unfortunately, many people think vaccines are "toxic" and don't vaccinate their children. This is incredibly dangerous for individuals who legitemately can't get a vaccine because they are immunodeficient or allergic. When enough people have a vaccine, the disease can't travel though the population and no one gets sick, even those unvaccinated. Get vaccinated today!</p>
