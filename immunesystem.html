                <p>I do not have a medical license, and I am not distributing medical advice. Ask you primary care physician for more information.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Immune System is made up of two main parts: the adaptive immune system, and the innate immume system. The innate immune system attacks all pathogens upon sight. The adaptive immune system takes more time to boot up, and is more effective.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container">
                <h2 id="innate-immune-system">The Innate Immune System</h2>
                <p>Let's meet the players of the Innate Immune System.</p>
                <h3 id="macrophage">Macrophages</h3>
                <p>Macrophages are a large soldier cell that sit stationary in tissue, or course through the blood and lymph. They ingest pathogens by extending their cytoplasm (skin) to engulf the pathogen. The pathogen is then broken down as enzymes are mixed with the pathogen. Macrophages in the lungs are called alveolar macrophages, and they are careful to not damage lung tissue. Macrophages can sense pathogens through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis">chemotaxis</a> (Wikipedia link).</p>
                <h3>Neutrophils</h3>
                <p>Neutrophils are the crazy fighters of your body. They release toxic chemicals that kill many bacteria, but also damage healthy cells. During a viral infection, neutrophils do more harm than good. Neutrophils can form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) by coating its DNA with lethal proteins, and expelling it in a ring around the cell. For those reasons, neutrophils kill themselves frequently to avoid too much collateral damage.</p>
                <h3>Monocytes</h3>
                <p>Monocytes are cells in your blood that can become <a href="immunesystem.html#macrophage">macrophages</a> if there is an infection.</p>
                <h3>Inflammation Cells</h3>
                <p>There are 3 main types of inflammation-causing cells, and they are responsible for allergies and asthma.</p>
                <h4>Mast Cells</h4>
                <p>Mast cells prime themselves with <a>antibodies</a>, and when they detect a trigger, they flood the blood and tissue with histamines, which cause massive inflammation.</p>
                <h4>Basophil</h4>
                <p>Basophils continue the inflammation caused by the mast cells.</p>
                <h4>Eosinophils</h4>
                <p>You only have a few eosinophils, and they make sure you feel horrible for a few days after the allergen is first exposed to you.</p>
                <div class="w3-panel w3-light-grey w3-border w3-round-large">
                    <h6>Note</h6>
                    <p>It is believed that these inflammation superchargers are so aggressive because they were for fighting parasitic worms, which are huge to your cells. Also, worms try to calm down the immune system.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Complement System</h3>
                <p>The complement system is a system of proteins that swarm around the blood at all time, in the millions. They make bacteria easier for <a href="immunesystem.html#macrophage">macrophages</a> to ingest, maim enemies, and poke holes in things until they die. It is incredibly complicated.</p>
                <h3>Natural Killer Cells</h3>
                <p>Natural killer cells are cells that check if cells are producing MHC Class I molecules. MHC Class I is a "window" into a cell to see what if it producing. Most cancerous cells and virus-infected cells stop producing MHC Class I to hide their shady insides. Natural killer cells kill those cells.</p>
                <h3>Dendritic Cells</h3>
                <p>You may have been wondering if there is an MHC Class II Molecule. There is! Dendritic cells take dead bacteria/virus bodies and show it to your adaptive immune system in MHC Class II Molecules. The adaptive immune system is picky that way.</p>
