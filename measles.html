                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>Measles is believed to have come from our transition to agricultural societies. The first descriptions of a disease somewhat resembling measles comes from a text in ancient India. Measles became a global endemic and was a fact of life until the development of the MMR vaccine. However, measles is still around today because of <a href="vaccines.html">antivaccination efforts</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Treatments & Prevention</h2>
                        <p>There are no effective treatments for measles other than fever reduces and the like. Measles can be easily prevented with a vaccine. Many parents want to keep their children from getting vaccinated because they believe that vaccines are "toxic." This has led to increased measles prevalence.</p>

                <h2>Spread</h2>
                <div class="w3-container w3-theme-l4">
                    <p>Measles is an incredibly contagious virus that is spread through the air via sneezing or coughing. This can also include breathing the same air as someone with measles. If you are unvaccinated and are exposed to measles, you have a 90% chance of getting infected. Scientists use a number known as R<sub>0</sub> to describe contagiousness. The R<sub>0</sub> describes how many people one infected person would infect if no one was vaccinated. Measles has one of the highest known R<sub>0</sub> values at 12-18.</p>

                <div class="w3-container w3-theme-l2">
                    <p>Symptoms of measles include a rash, coughing, pink eye, diarrohea, fever, malaise, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle pain, sore throat, post-nasal drip (fancy way of saying runny nose), and sneezing.</p>
